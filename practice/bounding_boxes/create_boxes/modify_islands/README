Steps:





Note1: in version 1 (in "aa_islands/"), I wrote the script "determine_offshore_onshore_isoline_endpoints.py" (and version 2).  The purpose of this
script was to determine the nearest isoline point to the hand-picked coastline "boundary points", ie the points which define the two halves of the
islands (now north and south, previously onshore and offshore).  However, with Will's clarification that we really want to be looking at the north
and south halves of the islands, I have decided it's easier to plot the isolines and coastlines, with the numbers of their respective points printed
at each point, and then hand-select the "starting points" of the coastline and the "boundary points" of isolines.  The selected pairs of points are stored
in the files "island_coast_starting_coordinates.txt" and "island_isoline_bounding_points.txt", respectively.  

Note2: Following Note2, I believe the approach outlined in Note1 will remove the need to rotate the isolines
